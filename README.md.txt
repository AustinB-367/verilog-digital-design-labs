# Digital Design Projects & Labs

A collection of projects and labs completed for my Digital Systems Design and Computer Architecture courses, implemented in Verilog.

## üìÅ Projects

### 16-Bit Carry Lookahead Adder
*   **Description:** A Hierarchical carry-lookahead adder (CLA) designed in structural Verilog. The CLA calculates carry signals in parallel to achieve a significant speedup over a ripple-carry adder design.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Structural Verilog implementation.
    *   Achieves ~5x speedup compared to a ripple-carry adder.
    *   Demonstrates the use of Generate (G) and Propagate (P) signals for optimized carry generation.
*   **Files:**
    *   `carry_lookahead_16bit.v` - Main Verilog source file.
    *   `16_bit_CLA Waveform.png` A screenshot of a successful simulation waveform.

### Other Labs
This repository also contains solutions for other fundamental digital design labs, including:
*   **Sequential Logic:** Flip-flops, registers, and finite state machines (FSMs).
*   **Behavioral Verilog & Synthesis:** FSMs and controllers synthesized to gate-level netlists.
*   **Common Digital Components:** Synchronous counters, clock dividers, and debounce circuits.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated
*   **Hardware Description Languages:** Verilog (Dataflow, Behavioral, and Structural modeling).
*   **Tools:** Simulators (e.g., ModelSim), Synthesis Tools, Git.
*   **Concepts:** Boolean logic, arithmetic logic unit (ALU) design, timing analysis, logic optimization, and the RTL design flow.
